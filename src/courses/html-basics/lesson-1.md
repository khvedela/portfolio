# What is HTML?

Welcome to your first lesson in web development! Let's start with the absolute basics.

## The Foundation of the Web

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. Every website you've ever visited - Google, YouTube, Facebook - they all use HTML.

Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of a website:
- **HTML** = Structure (the bones)
- **CSS** = Styling (the skin, clothes, makeup)
- **JavaScript** = Behavior (the muscles, movement)

## What Does "Markup Language" Mean?

A markup language uses **tags** to define elements. It's like adding labels to different parts of a document.

For example, if you were marking up a book:
- "This is a chapter title" → `<h1>Chapter 1</h1>`
- "This is a paragraph" → `<p>Once upon a time...</p>`
- "This is important" → `<strong>Don't forget!</strong>`

HTML doesn't program logic (like JavaScript). It just describes what things are.

## How HTML Works

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

Breaking it down:
- `<p>` = Opening tag (starts the paragraph)
- `This is a paragraph` = Content (what the user sees)
- `</p>` = Closing tag (ends the paragraph)

The browser reads this and displays it correctly.

## Why Learn HTML?

1. **It's the foundation** - You can't build websites without it
2. **It's simple** - Unlike programming languages, HTML is just structure
3. **It's everywhere** - Emails, websites, apps - they all use HTML
4. **Career opportunities** - Every web developer needs HTML

## A Quick Example

Here's a simple HTML snippet:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is my first web page!</p>
<p>I'm learning HTML.</p>
```

This creates:
- A large heading saying "Welcome to My Website"
- Two paragraphs of text

That's it! No complex code, just labeled content.

## Key Takeaway

HTML is **not** a programming language. It's a markup language. You're not writing code that "runs" - you're describing the structure of content that browsers display.

In the next lesson, we'll look at the actual structure of a complete HTML document.
